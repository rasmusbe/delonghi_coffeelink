"""Unit tests for the machine-derived beverage catalogue (catalog.py).

Anchored on ``fixtures/soul_properties.json``: a real 312-property dump from a
reference PrimaDonna Soul (DL-millcore), anonymised - the serial and every
user-entered name (profiles, custom recipes, beans) were overwritten with
placeholders and their CRCs recomputed, so the file carries no device or
household identifiers. Every count below was measured against that dump; they
are pinned deliberately, so a future parser edit that quietly changes what the
integration believes the machine can make fails here instead of in someone's
kitchen.

Loads only the dependency-free modules, like test_counters.py, so the suite runs
with plain pytest and no Home Assistant installed.
