# it does NOT push status changes on its own. So this interval is not just a
# session timeout guard, it is the status sensor's resolution.
#
# MUST stay strictly below DEFAULT_SCAN_INTERVAL. With the two equal, the
# `now - last < INTERVAL` guard in the coordinator skipped roughly every other
# poll: the keepalive is stamped a few hundred ms into a poll, so the next poll
# arrives a hair under one interval later and the write slips a whole cycle.
# Measured on the reference Soul - successive `device_connected` writes were
# +61 / +30 / +31 / +60 s. Since this interval IS the status resolution, that
