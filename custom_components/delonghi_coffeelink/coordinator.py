        status changes on its own. Verified on ECAM610.55 / ``DL-millcore`` /

        with no write the datapoint had not moved in **five days** while the

        looks healthy - while Machine Status reports a value that may be days
        old. Automations keyed on it simply never fire.

        Never fatal: a failed keepalive costs one stale poll, so it must not take
        the whole update down with it. Never quiet either. A keepalive that
        fails every time rebuilds the exact blind spot this method exists to
        close - polls green, machine Online, counters moving, status frozen - so
        the first failure and the recovery are warnings and only the repeats are
