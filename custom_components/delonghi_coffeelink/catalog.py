"""Read the machine's own beverage catalogue out of its Ayla datapoints.

The machine already tells us everything a beverage catalogue needs; the
integration just never read it. Every recipe-bearing datapoint is a
self-describing binary blob::

    d0 <len> <family 2B> [<profile 1B>] <bevid 1B> <TLV params...> <crc16>

``len`` is the frame size minus the start byte, and the CRC is the same CRC16
AUG-CCITT the command builder already uses, so a blob can be *proved* intact
before anything is derived from it. The reference PrimaDonna Soul (312
properties) publishes 194 such blobs in ten families; these six carry the
catalogue, and are the only ones this module reads:

===========  ====  ==============================================================
family       n     meaning
===========  ====  ==============================================================
``b0 f0``    28    factory descriptor - the capability schema (min/default/max)
``a6 f0``    140   per-profile instance - the current value of each parameter
``a8 f0``    5     a per-profile ordered short list of beverage ids
``a4 f0``    2     profile names (21-byte cells of UTF-16BE, user-entered)
``aa f0``    2     custom-recipe slot names (same 21-byte cells)
``ba f0``    7     bean-system names
===========  ====  ==============================================================

The other four are the serial number (``a1 0f``), the machine settings including
the PIN (``95 0f``), the monitor blob (``75 0f``) and the command-response
channel (``a9 f0``). They are deliberately out of scope here, and out of the
diagnostic dump too - see ``command_builder.recipe_dump_lines``.

What the ``a8f0`` lists are NOT: the set of drinks the machine can make. On the
reference machine all ten lists (five profiles, two dumps taken days apart)
carry one identical set of 19 ids in four different orders, and between the two
dumps profiles 1, 4 and 5 changed order only - two adjacent transpositions each,
which is what a recency ordering looks like. Meanwhile three drinks that have
factory descriptors, per-profile recipes and lifetime counters (``0x19``
long_black, ``0x1a`` mug_to_go, ``0x1b`` brew_over_ice) appear in no list at
all. So membership is not evidence in either direction: it is an ordered short
list per profile, and a drink can be missing from every one of them and still be
brewable.

That caution is not theoretical. An earlier version of this parser read the ids
from ``payload[2:]``, assuming a header byte the frames do not have, and so ate
each list's first entry. It reported the bean-system drink as absent from every
list when the machine puts it first on all five, and the resulting "the contents
move between dumps" was an artefact of the off-by-one rather than a finding.

Two rules make the whole thing parseable without per-beverage special cases:

* **TLV**: tags ``0x01``, ``0x09`` and ``0x0f`` carry a 16-bit big-endian value,
  every other tag carries 8 bits. That single rule consumes all 140 ``a6f0``
  payloads with zero leftover bytes. In a ``b0f0`` descriptor the same tags
  carry a *triple* (min, default, max) instead of one value.
* **Parse by family, never by property name.** The Soul writes
  ``d039_1_rec_espresso`` and the Eletta ``d059_rec_1_espresso``, with the
  numbers shifted by 20 for the same drink; the blob header is identical on
  both.

Everything here is pure: no Home Assistant, no I/O, no network. Callers hand it
the property dict the coordinator already polls.

Deliberate refusals, because a beverage button that lies is worse than one that
is missing:

* A blob that fails any gate (prefix, declared length, CRC) is *unreadable*,
  never *absent* - it never removes a beverage from the catalogue.
* A TLV walk that leaves a trailing byte returns ``None`` rather than a partial
  parse, so a synthesized command can never be built from a half-understood
  payload.
* ``off_default`` is ``None``, not ``False``, when the factory descriptor is
  truncated or missing. Cross-profile disagreement is reported separately as
  ``profiles_differ`` - it is a weaker signal and must not be read as "the user
  changed this".
* ``in_priority_list`` is never an existence test, for either answer. The
  ``a8f0`` lists are a per-profile ordered *selection* of fixed size, not the
  set of drinks the machine can make - see below - so a drink can be missing
  from every one of them and still be brewed daily.
